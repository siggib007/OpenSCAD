# OpenSCAD
Just some random OpenSCAD files from my 3D printing experiments. 
If you don't know what OpenSCAD is, it is a programing language to define 3d objects which can then be saved as STL which is the universal 3D file format.
STL is then sliced into gcode which the 3D printers use to actually print the object.
